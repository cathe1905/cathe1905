## Hi there! 👋

I’m Catherin Romero, a passionate tech enthusiast with a love for technology, programming logic, movies, continuous learning, and cooking.    

🌱 Currently, I'm diving into the exciting worlds of Python, Flask, SQL, SQLAlchemy, Pytest, and improving my English skills.

I’m always on the lookout for opportunities to collaborate on open-source software projects and any initiative that fosters community-driven tech development. 💞️ If you have an interesting project or need someone to help create educational content for programming beginners, I’d love to hear about it!

Feel free to reach out to me at 📫 [catherinr24@gmail.com](mailto:catherinr24@gmail.com) or connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/catherin-romero-web-developer).

A little fun fact about me: ⚡ I spent 16 years as a Boy Scout in a Christian Evangelical church, where I mastered Morse code, semaphore alphabet, and an impressive array of knots.   

My pronouns are 😄 she/her, and I look forward to connecting with fellow tech enthusiasts and collaborators.

Let’s create something amazing together!
